# Bootcamp-Project #10: Project Movies
This projects core goal was about fetching data from an API and display them on a page using "Route" and "Router" so that user can click around the website to see a more detailed site of each movie. The project was realized in a pairprogramming setup.

## Learning content and lessons learned:
- Pair programming
- How to use React router to create multi-page applications
- How to use placeholders in urls to pick dynamic parts from urls
- Practice using APIs in React - combining `useState` with `useEffect`

First of all we decided on the structure of the project/components. The data was fetched quickly and the structure was also set up quickly and without any bigger struggles. For the styling we worked on the project seperately, which required clear naming and communication. This pairprogramming setup was quite an interesting experience, since the team members were located around the globe (Mexico, Switzerland) and working hours looked pretty different. But we are happy about the whole experience and how the project turned out. 
Technologies and methods used during this project: javascript, react, react-router-dom, css, flexbox, vs code liveshare, netlify, pairprogramming,
